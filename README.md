# King's Quest 1 - Redux

Don your adventurer's cap, ready your medieval flamethrower, and return to Daventry to experience the classic adventure again! Will Graham find the secret hideout of the thieving dwarf? Can the Carrot of Resurrection still raise the goat from the dead? Who planted a palm tree in Daventry? And what does the "duck" action do, anyway? Play on, intrepid adventurer!

King's Quest was originally released in 1984 as a premier game to showcase the capabilities of the IBM PCjr. The game went on to spawn numerous sequels, in addition to several ports and remakes.

King's Quest 1 Redux builds upon the original game by adding new features and extra polish, while cleaning up numerous small issues. This game is a revamped and upgraded version of the 1987 enhanced EGA version of King's Quest 1.


## How To Play

The original game came out in the mid-1980s, and while most of us don't have a spare Tandy laying about, there are several ways to still play old computer games on modern computers via either DOSBox or ScummVM. King's Quest 1 Redux can be played on any system which supports either DOSBox or ScummVM.

DOSBox is an emulator program which emulates an IBM PC compatible computer running a DOS operating system.

ScummVM is a program that supports numerous adventure game engines via virtual machines, allowing the user to play supported adventure games on their platform of choice. 

Both DOSBox and ScummVM are viable programs which can be used to play King's Quest 1 Redux.  If you have not used either of these programs before, ScummVM is recommended, since it is easier to set up and use than DOSBox, which requires more configuration.

**[DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/)**  
- Move the `kq1redux` folder where you normally place games when using DOSBox
- Launch DOSBox
- Change into the `kq1redux` directory
- Launch the game by typing: `sierra`

**[ScummVM](https://www.scummvm.org/)**  
- Launch ScummVM
- Click on the `Add Game...` button and select the kq1redux folder.
- Select the game which says `Fanmade AGI Game` from the list and click the Start button.
